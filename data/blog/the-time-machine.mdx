# Goodbye old blog

Goodbye [old blog](https://osherove.com/blog).

I stopped writing in my old blog a long time ago. I am currenly in my web3 journey and have decided to detail it here. 
[Twitter spoiled me](https://twitter.com/royosherove) and it was too easy to write short form there. but long form is where I think the real value is.

# Hello new blog
Much like my old blog, This blog will discuss anything I find interesting 
or would like to keep for propsperity so others don't have to find it themselves the hard way.

Since it will be focused on a whole new journey I am also posting it on a different domain.

# Some things I've been learning

I've been going through several journies at the same time :

* Writing the third edition of [Art of Unit Testing (with examples in JS)](https://artofunittesting.com) (currently in [MEAP form](https://www.manning.com/books/the-art-of-unit-testing-third-edition))
* Learning JavaScript and TypeScript deeply for the book. Last time I've touched JS, it was when [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) was the big hit
* Learning React, Svelte and switching to VsCode 
* Learning how Blockchains work
* Learning Ethereum Smart Contracts, Web3 Frontend Development and frameworks like [ethers](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [truffle](https://trufflesuite.com/), [hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) and more.
* Learning to [create NFTs](https://boredweb3.com)
* Working on my Legato Protocol project, Identity Protocol Project and Audio Label Project (more to come on those)

That's it. If you have any comments or questions, I'm [on twitter](https://twitter.com/royosherove)
